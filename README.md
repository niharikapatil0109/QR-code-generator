# QR Code Generator - Python Project

The QR Code Generator is a Python-based application that allows users to create QR codes for given links using the "qrcodegen" library. QR codes are two-dimensional barcodes capable of storing various types of information, including URLs, text, contact information, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- qrcodegen library

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install the "qrcodegen" library using pip:

pip install qrcodegen

## Functionality

1. **QR Code Generation**: The core functionality of the project is centered around creating QR codes based on user-provided links. The "qrcodegen" library facilitates the efficient generation of QR codes, ensuring that the encoded information is accurately and compactly represented.

2. **Link Input**: Users can input any valid link (e.g., a website URL) for which they want to generate a QR code.

3. **QR Code Display**: The application displays the generated QR code on the screen, allowing users to view and verify the code before saving it.

4. **Save QR Code**: The project allows users to save the generated QR code to their local machine for future use or sharing.

## Benefits

- Provides an easy-to-use tool for generating QR codes from links, making information sharing more convenient.
- Enables users to quickly create QR codes for websites, social media profiles, contact details, and more.
- Encodes information securely within the QR code, ensuring data integrity.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the support of the "qrcodegen" library, which enabled us to create this QR Code Generator project in Python. QR codes have become an essential part of modern information exchange, and this project aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for creating QR codes for various purposes.
